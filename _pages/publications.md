> IN this research I have emplimented a new algorithm by using python to find the Wiener graph of the Polythiophene and providing a third-degree polynomial for it. The algorithm is based on the [Wiener index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_index) and [Wiener polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_polynomial) of the graph. The algorithm is implemented in [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) and [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).
